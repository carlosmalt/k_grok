# Homework 2

This multi-part assignment will have separately graded sections.

 * Review a patch (10 points)
 * Submit a patch series (10 points)

## Use asciinema

Record all of your command-line work separately for each part of the homework:
hw2-review, hw2-patch.

Example: `asciinema rec /tmp/hw2-review`

After starting the recording, launch screen and create multiple terminal buffers
(i.e. console sessions) in screen via `<CTRL>+a c`. Switch between them via
commands such as `<CTRL>+a "` (that the control and letter a keys pressed
simultaneously, followed by a press of the double quote key).

You can play a recording back with shortened inactive times.

Example: `asciinema play -w 1 /tmp/hw2-review`

Upload asciinema files to Google Docs and include a link in an email to the
instructor. Not doing this will cost 2 points. Use subjects such as:

 * [HW 2] Review asciinema
 * [HW 2] Patch asciinema

## Review a patch (10 points)

Send an email to the instructor reviewing the following:

[PATCH] Optimize int_sqrt for small values for faster idle
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1063272.html

The subject of this email should be:

`Re: [PATCH] Optimize int_sqrt for small values for faster idle`

In this review, include:

 * suggestions for improving the patch

 * name 3 people who modified this file
   `apt install git-gui`, and see `git-gui blame`

   * WARNING: You can't use a shallow clone, so either start with a full clone or
     convert a shallow clone to full with:
     `git fetch --unshallow upstream` 
     `git checkout upstream/master` 

   * NOTE: If you execute 'git gui blame' and see an error message that refers to
     there being no DISPLAY environment variable being set, then that means that
     you need install X or enable X forwarding when you ssh into your VM.
     [X for Mac OS X](www.xquartz.org) or [X for Windows](x.cygwin.com)
     `ssh -Y ${HOSTNAME}` (also, multiple screens can cause difficulties, 
     so try unplugging them if you can't see a window).
     Only use the `-Y` argument when you ssh to something secure like your VM.
     Otherwise add something like `ForwardX11Timeout 1D` to `~/.ssh/config` and use
     the  `-X` argument.

 * a list of everywhere the function is called

 * spot-checks or proofs of correctness

   In other words, call the function with a few values and compare it to what a
   calculator or other trusted source gives you. Do this with a kernel module.
   Think of good corner cases for unsigned integers, such as 0 and the max
   unsigned int of that size, along with a few normal values.

   You could write a mathematical proof, if that's something you like to do.

 * benchmarks of previous code vs. new code
   benchmark in a kernel module, not userspace
   use perf trace events, and graph CDF and PDF,
   see `k_grok/exercises/tracepoint-silly/`

   Since `int_sqrt` takes much less time than `printk`, jiffies aren't high enough
   resolution.  Include the `linux/time.h` header and use `ktime_get()`, and macros
   like `ktime_sub(lhs, rhs)` and `ktime_to_ns(...)` instead of standard math ops:

```C
    ...
    #include <linux/time.h>
    ...
    static void silly_thread_func(void)
    {
        static unsigned long count;
        ktime_t x, y;
        s64 z;
        ...
        x = ktime_get();
        ...
        // operations to be measured
        // WARNING: Take out the printk! Only measure the optimzed sqrt function.
        ...
        y = ktime_get();
        z = ktime_to_ns(ktime_sub(y, x));
        trace_me_silly ( (unsigned long)z, count);
    }
```

## Submit a patch series

Reroll (i.e. act as if you are the original author, revising it) the patch you
just reviewed, addressing the feedback of the kernel developers and your
review. Send the rerolled patch to the instructor.  It should include
the appropriate version in the subject's tag.

Add a new optimized version of the `int_sqrt` function for a new random range of
numbers. Regarding the random range and conclusions about bit length, you can
deduce that a number from, say, 65536 to 4294967295 is at least 8 bits
and less than 32 bits.

Add a prototype declaration after the one for `int_sqrt` in `include/linux/kernel.h`
Add the implementation after `int_sqrt` in `lib/int_sqrt.c`:

```C
        unsigned long int_sqrt_optimized(unsigned long x){
        ...
        }
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(int_sqrt_optimized);
```

Go to https://www.random.org, change max to 1000000, and generate two random
numbers. See the prandom_u32() function in the kernel for generating numbers to
test, and
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2509679/how-to-generate-a-random-number-from-within-a-range
for ranges of random numbers maybe get some ideas from
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1100090/looking-for-an-efficient-integer-square-root-algorithm-for-arm-thumb2

For example::

```C
        #include <linux/kernel.h>
        #include <linux/random.h>
        ...
        static void silly_thread_func(void)
        {
            ...
            static unsigned long rnd, min, max, num_bins, num_rand, bin_size;
            ...
            min = ???; // from random.org
            max = ???; // from random.org
            num_bins = max + 1;
            num_rand = ULONG_MAX + 1;
            bin_size = num_rand / num_bins;
            defect = num_rand % num_bins;
            ...
            do {
                rnd = prandom_u32();
            }
            // This is carefully written not to overflow
            while (num_rand - defect <= (unsigned long)rnd);
            ...
            // Use rnd here
        }
```

Cite the source of anything you don't write youreself int the patch history
(i.e. below the `---` mark)..

Benchmark as above. The benchmark kernel module source should be included as
separate emails in the series. Add the silly dir under `${KERNEL_SOURCE}/tools`,
and then you can generate a patch.

Remember all of the other things the documentation says a patch should have.
